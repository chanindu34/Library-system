# Library Management System

A robust Python-based system that manages books, members, and borrowing transactions. This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to build a scalable application, not just a simple script.

## Key Features

* **Smart Books:** Books track their own status (Available/Borrowed) and history.
* **Member Rules:** Enforces limits (e.g., max 3 books per person) to prevent hoarding.
* **Safety First:** Prevents "double booking" or returning books that weren't borrowed.
* **Searchable:** Uses efficient lookups to find books and members instantly.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Concepts:** Classes, State Management, Type Hinting, UUIDs.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run the system:

```bash
python library_system.py
